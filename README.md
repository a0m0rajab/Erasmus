## Lessons Full Description (from university site.)


###   Algorithms and Data Structures    
Description:
Students will have demonstrated the ability to: analyze worst-case running times of algorithms using asymptotic analysis. Synthesize dynamic programming algorithms, and analyze them. Explain the major algorithms for sorting. Derive lower bounds on the running time of comparison-sorting algorithms.. Explain the major elementary data structures for implementing dynamic sets and the analyses of operations performed on them. Synthesize new data structures by augmenting existing data structures, etc.

Requirements:
Programming in C, C++, Java or C#, mathematical analysis - basic knowledge.

teachers:
Joanna Karbowska-Chilińska (j.karbowska@pb.edu.pl) 
Krzysztof Ostrowski (k.ostrowski@pb.edu.pl) 

###      Software engineering           
Description:
Requirements issues are essential for documenting and evaluating user needs. Requirements represent the real-world needs of users, customers and other stakeholders affected by the system. Scope and subject of software engineering. Essential motivations and concepts. Areas of software engineering – overview. Classical (waterfall) software lifecycle model. Conceptual modeling. Languages for modeling and specification. Object-oriented analysis using UML. UML Diagrams (Use cases, Modeling of logical system structure: class diagrams, Modeling of system structure: other structural diagrams, Modeling system dynamics: sequence and communication diagrams, Modeling system dynamics: representing object’s state); System design: system architecture. Requirements engineering: requirements determination, requirements specification. Software testing: terms, place in software development process. CASE tools.

Requirements:
Knowledge of object-oriented programming.

teachers:
Marek Krętowski (m.kretowski@pb.edu.pl) 
Tomasz Łukaszuk (t.lukaszuk@pb.edu.pl) 
###    Quality management and control   
Description:
Principles of Quality Management. Standardization: origin and basics. International and local organizations for standardization European certifying systems. Voluntary area certification – European Keymark; Obligatory area certification – New Approach Directives, CE sign. Quality management systems in conformity to ISO 9000:2008 standards. Quality management systems documentation. ISO 9000:2008 standards implementation in Polish and foreign organizations. Management systems in different sectors. Integration of management systems. Tools of Quality Management.

Requirements:
Getting new skills of implementing requirements of ISO 9001 standard to the company, awareness of quality problems in organisation, skills in area of using quality control tools.

teachers:
Urszula Kobylińska (u.kobylinska@pb.edu.pl) 
###  Data visualiation and communication
Description:
Proper data visualization is an important skill of engineer, especially when amount of data is growing in many different fields. Data visualization allows the use of different presentations techniques to better understand the data. Multiple visualization methods generate environment for scientific review of the data.

Requirements:
.

teachers:
Marcin Skoczylas (m.skoczylas@pb.edu.pl) 
###          Project management         
Description:
Subject description: Basic navigation in Microsoft Project. Defining task logic, milestones, summary tasks and recurring tasks. Task relationships, constraints and advanced actions on tasks. Creation of project schedule. Critical path of project, project calendar. Defining project resources. Resource management and allocation. EVA analysis. Project baseline. Project tracking and control. Customizing reports. Publishing project information. Customizing views, tables, filters and groups. Export and import of project data.

Requirements:
Skills: Course contains software support for the critical concepts and theories project managers must master. It aims at managing project through initiation, tracking, controlling, performance measuring and closing the Microsoft Project.

teachers:
Aleksandra Gulc (a.gulc@pb.edu.pl) 

###      Human-Computer Interaction  
Description:
Principles of designing human-computer interfaces. Discussion of audio interfaces, basic psychoacoustic processing, synthesis and speech recognition. Discussion of graphical user interfaces, visual psychophysics, elements 2D and 3D graphics, the creation of windowing GUI applications. Overview of non-traditional interfaces (touch, gestures and motion capture, brain).

Requirements:
Object Oriented Programming
